# Arch linux install
You should always follow the install located at the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide) but if for some reason you are havingtrouble I hope this tutorial can help in some way.

## Standalone Install
### First Step: Prep the install media
Prep the install media anyway you would prefer. I will not go over this in detail as there are many tutorials out there that already cover this. You will need to download the Arch ISO and use a bootable usb or cd if you prefer. 

### Installing Arch
With the USB plugged into the computer boot up your computer. **NOTE**:Make sure your boot sequence includes the USB first if you already have another Operating system on the computer. If you are having trouble most computers have a select boot sequence during the initial bios splashscreen and you should be able to select the USB.**ENDNOTE**
```
You should be presented with the Arch live install which should look like this:
Arch Linux 3.17.6-1-ARCH (tty1)

archiso login: root (automatic login)
root@archiso ~ #
```
