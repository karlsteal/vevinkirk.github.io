## Step 1: Setup Github pages

If you haven't done so already setup a site using Github pages as its free and it is what we will be using to host our static site!
I use [beautiful jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) as my theme but you can choose to use whatever you want that is compatible with github pages.

## Step 2: Setup RSS feed\

Podcasts work by feeding from an RSS feed which is an xml document that states certain values that podcast sites like Apple and Spotify recognize as podcast feeds .
